## 📁 Index

### Basic Programs
- `Addition.c` - Simple addition of two numbers
- `Average.c` - Calculates average of given numbers
- `Division.c` - Division with error handling
- `EvenOrOdd.c` - Checks if a number is even or odd
- `HelloWorld.c` - Basic "Hello World" program
- `InputAddition.c` - Takes input and performs addition
- `SmallerOrGreater.c` - Compares two numbers

### Mathematical Programs
- `Calculator.c` - Basic arithmetic calculator
- `CurrencyDenominationCalculator.c` - Calculates currency denominations
- `TotalmarksAvgPercentageCalc.c` - Computes student marks statistics

### Control Flow Programs
- `ElseIf.c` - Demonstrates else-if ladder
- `PrintEvenNumbers.c` - Prints even numbers in a range
- `PrintOneToTenForLoop.c` - Prints 1-10 using a `for` loop

### Number Manipulation Programs
#### Find Largest Number
- `FindLargestNumberFrom2Numbers.c` - Finds the largest of two numbers
- `FindLargestNumberFrom3Numbers.c` - Finds the largest of three numbers

#### Swap Variables
- `SwapVariablesWithExtraVar.c` - Swaps values using a temporary variable
- `SwapVariablesWithoutExtraVar.c` - Swaps values using XOR bitwise operation (memory efficient)

### Array Programs
- `1DArray.c` - Demonstrates basic 1D array initialization and access
- `1DArray2.c` - Takes user input to populate and print a 1D array
- `2DArray.c` - Takes input for a 3x3 matrix and prints it (with a transpose attempt)

### Matrix Operations
- `MatrixAdd.c` - Adds two 3x3 matrices and prints the result
- `TransMatrix.c` - Takes input for a 3x3 matrix and attempts to transpose it

### Pattern Printing
- `Pattern4×4.c` - Prints a 4x4 grid of asterisks (`*`)
- `pyramidpattern.c` - Prints a pyramid pattern using asterisks (`*`)
