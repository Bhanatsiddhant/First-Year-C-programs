# PPS Codes for ENTC Engineering

This repository contains fundamental C programming examples. These programs cover basic concepts taught in C Programming.

## 📁 File Structure

### Basic Programs
- `Addition.c` - Simple addition of two numbers
- `Average.c` - Calculates average of given numbers
- `Division.c` - Division with error handling
- `EvenOrOdd.c` - Checks if number is even or odd
- `HelloWorld.c` - Basic "Hello World" program
- `InputAddition.c` - Takes input and performs addition
- `SmallerOrGreater.c` - Compares two numbers

### Mathematical Programs
- `Calculator.c` - Basic arithmetic calculator
- `CurrencyDenominationCalculator.c` - Calculates currency denominations
- `TotalmarksAvgPercentageCalc.c` - Computes student marks statistics

### Control Flow Programs
- `ElseIf.c` - Demonstrates else-if ladder
- `PrintEvenNumbers.c` - Prints even numbers in range
- `PrintOneToTenForLoop.c` - Prints 1-10 using for loop
- `StudentGrade.c` - Calculates student grade from marks

### Number Manipulation Programs
#### Find Largest Number
- `FindLargestNumberFrom2Numbers.c` - Finds largest of two numbers
- `FindLargestNumberFrom3Numbers.c` - Finds largest of three numbers

#### Swap Variables
- `SwapVariablesWithExtraVar.c` - Swaps values using temporary variable
- `SwapVariablesWithoutExtraVar.c` - Swaps values using XOR bitwise operation (memory efficient)

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Bhanatsiddhant/PPS-Codes.git
  ```
2. Compile any program using:
  ```bash
  # For GCC Compiler
  gcc filename.c -o output

  # For Clang Compiler
  clang filename.c -o output
  ```
3. Run the executable:
  ```bash
  ./output
  ```
